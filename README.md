# reasonmtl-dojo-3

## Installing / Getting started

All the dependencies can be install via your favorite package manager:

```shell
yarn install
```

That's it! You're up and running, you can start the project with:

```shell
yarn start
```

## Developing

Assuming you're developing with Visual Studio Code (if you're not, you should definitely give it a shot, it's awesome), all you need to develop is this extension: [vscode-reasonml](https://github.com/reasonml-editor/vscode-reasonml).

This will give you compilation errors in the editor and code intelliscence.
